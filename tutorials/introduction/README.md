# An Introduction to Web Maps 

This guide in intended to provide a quick overview of some of the main concepts when working with web maps. Maps and web maps are huge topics and this guide is not intended to go over all concepts. Instead, this page will serve as an introductory lesson for people that have little to no  experience working with maps in the web.

## A very quick history of web maps

In 1996 a company called [Mapquest](http://www.mapquest.com/) introduced a web service for displaying maps on the web. The service allowed people to zoom and pan over a map. Every map was constructed of a single image created by a server. That meant that everytime you requested a new zoom level or moved the map in any direction, you would have to request a new image to the server.

In 2005 [Google Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps) came and revolutionzed web mapping. Originally designed as a desktop service until Google bought the company behind it, Google Maps used a different technique to render maps on the web: [Tile Maps](). Tile Maps are collections of small images that are stitch together to create a complete map view. Together with [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started), this techinique allows users to zoom and move while keeping most of the tiles that are still relevant and only fetching new ones.

Today most web maps are tile maps. Although a lot of map providers are shifting towards a different technique called [Vector Tile Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_tiles). Instead of sending grids of images to the client, Vector Tile maps sends packets of information about a tile and then the client renders in real-time those packets in the browser to make a map. This allows for a more smooth experience since the client is rendering and fetching data during runtime.

#### Map Providers

So at the end, web maps are just collections of images (or data about how to render those maps) that are stich together. The next question is well, how do we get those images and use them.

There are several map companies that offer web map services. Some of this companies are: [Google Maps](maps.google.com), [Mapbox](mapbox.com) and [Mapzen](mapzen.com). This companies provide a lot of different services and products around maps, and one of them is giving you access to images on their servers for you to load a tile map. In most cases, this services can be used for free and only if you request huge amounts of data, they will start charging you.

But there is also a free and open source alternative. [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84) is a collaborative project that aims to create a free editable map of the world. This service is free for anyone to use and edit and does not require any type of registration.

#### Map Projections

Since the earth is a sphere and your screen is a flat 2D surface, a [Map Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection) needs to be used to transfer latitudes and longitudes of locations from the surface of a the earth into locations on a plane. An important thing to consider is that ALL map projections disort the surface in some point.

There are [different map projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections) used for different purpuses and cases. Today, most web map providers use the [Mercator Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection). Originally designed for nautical purposes, the Mercator has become one of the standars for web maps. One important thing to consider is that the Mercator Projection disorts the plane towards the poles, showing them far more bigger than what they really are. This make things look much more bigger than what they really are.

Mercator disortion towards the poles

Map Projections are a very hot topic because of how they dissort information. To learn more:

####  Web Map Libraries

To request and use a tile map from any map provider(free or paid) you need to use a javascript library to load those tiles in the right way and fetch them when needed. Which library to use depends on the which map provider you are using. If you want to load maps from Google you need to use [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) own library. For almost all other map providers you can use a free and open-source library called [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). Leaflet is very popular library for web maps. Although [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.1.1/) and [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com/documentation/mapzen-js/) have their own javascript libraries, both are extensions of [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) that have custom code but that are open source as well.

## Custom Maps 

You can also create and host your own tiles. While this goes out of the scope of this introduction, you can use a server to deliver custom-based tiles and style them with TileMill or something similar.

Another alternative is to customize and change existing web maps. You can do this with most services. Either when requesting them or using their services like [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/styles/).

## Overlaying things on a Map

So where does Mappa fit? 

One thing is to load and display a map and another is to show things on top of that map, for instance a marker pointing to your home. With [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) you can overlay and position elements over the map in a very easy way. Here's the a sample code from Leaflet's home page to overlay a marker over an Openstreet map:

```javascript
// Creates the map object and attaches that object to the body of the html. This also sets the starting latiute, longitud and zoom level
var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);

// Select which tile layers to show. In this case, OSM
L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map);

// Add a marker to the map in lat 51.5 and lng -0.09
L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map)
    .bindPopup('A pretty CSS3 popup.<br> Easily customizable.')
    .openPopup();
```
Results in this:

![leaflet marker](images/leafletMarker.png)

And here's the code for doing the same with Google Maps (Taken form [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/icon-simple)):
```javascript
var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
          zoom: 4,
          center: {lat: -33, lng: 151}
        });

var image = 'icon.png';
var beachMarker = new google.maps.Marker({
          position: {lat: -33.890, lng: 151.274},
          map: map,
          icon: image
      });
```

Results in this:

![Google Marker](images/googleMapsMarker.png)

One thing you will notice is that this are static images that are fixed to a specific location in the map. You can move and zoom around and the markers will stay in position. But what if you want to do something more interactive? Perhaps add movement and sound to it? You can create and build you own overlay's for each map provider or ... use [Mappa](). Mappa allows you to attach a `<canvas>` object on top of a tile map for almost all map providers. This means you can overlay a [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) sketch in top of a map and bind them together, just as with the marker. This allows you to create more interactive experiences:
